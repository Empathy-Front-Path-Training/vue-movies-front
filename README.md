# Movies-front
This project has been done using Daniel Fernandez's [search engine](https://github.com/daniferna/imdb_search_empathy-academy), so in order to use it, you should first follow the instructions from his repository and when you have it up and running, come back here to start the front.

Assuming you have the backend running, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and then, on the project's directory execute the command

    npm install

After all the node modules are installed you will only have to execute the command

    npm run serve

And the front will start running. If you have followed the specified instructions for the backend, everything should be running fine now.
